ExpTargets_Par3 = Learners at different levels may view their language proficiency differently. Beginners may be so pleased with their rapid initial progress that they may overestimate their skills. But it is also possible that they feel that there is still so much to learn that they underrate their proficiency. Some intermediate learners may master the language well enough for their own specific purposes but may not realise that their proficiency is not adequate for other purposes.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A1_#Item4 = Learn to use a bilingual dictionary or a simple monolingual one. Dictionaries are of great help if used properly.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#B1_#Item4 = Study guidebooks on writing.
ExpSupport_Par1 = In most tests you are not allowed to use a dictionary, grammar book or a spell checker, let alone ask somebody for help (that would be considered cheating!). In real life you can often resort to external help and thus enhance your performance compared with the performance you can show in a test situation.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A1_#Item1_#GA = Attend language classes so that you learn more sentence level grammar and Irish vocabulary, paying attention to sentence formation and connecting main and subordinate clauses.

Or you may <a id="underestimate" href="javascript:;">underestimate</a> your skills because you encounter problems with a particular skill.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A2_#Item4_#NO = Pay attention to how to express politeness in Norwegian: impoliteness can be more irritating than linguistic errors and prevent you from achieving the aims you have for your letter or message.

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A1_#Item5_#EL = Try to learn how new words are typically formed in Greek.
ExpTargets_Par4 = Both intermediate and advanced learners may underestimate their proficiency. They have typically learned the language for a number of years, and although they have achieved quite high levels of proficiency, they are also aware that there is still a lot to learn if they have set their target level very high and wish to achieve an 'ideal' level of proficiency, such as that of many native speakers.
SelfAssessFeedback_UnderEst_Par1#B2#A2 = In the self-assessment task you gave responses which we would normally expect from a learner at level A2.  However, your test result suggests that you are at level B2.
Questionnaire_Age = What age are you?
Message_VersionOutofDate = Warning: your DIALANG software is out of date!<br /><br />A new version of the DIALANG software is now available, and the version you are currently using is no longer supported, and may not run at all.<br /><br />Please visit the DIALANG web site at www.dialang.org to download the latest version.

AdvisoryTips_Intro_#C1 = The following suggestions may help you make progress towards C2:
ExpDiffTests_Par2 = Purpose of the test: a test which is used to give you an end-of-course grade will probably not give you the same information as a test aimed at measuring your skills in absolute terms, against an international scale, which tells you what learners at that level can do in real life.

AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#C1_#Item1_#NO = Listen to radio programmes, watch TV and films in Norwegian on a regular basis.
ExpWorkTests_Par1 = Many learners take language tests as a part of their language training at work. Work-based language tests can often be very specific in terms of content and the kind of language required - specific to the needs of the occupation or profession in question. Because DIALANG is an assessment system that covers a range of general contexts and situations of language use, it is difficult to compare these two kinds of tests: your ability to use the language required in your work may not be at the same level as your general language proficiency. Also, it may be difficult to compare the standards (levels of proficiency) required in the different tests.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#B1_#Item1 = Actively seek opportunities to expand your vocabulary and your knowledge of idioms.

ExpTargets_Par1 = How high you set your target level for language learning may affect how you rate your proficiency. For example, if you are a beginner or an intermediate learner and you set your target to be native-like proficiency, you will have a long way to go and you may feel that you are making such slow progress that you cannot possibly be very good - you may consequently underrate yourself.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A1_#Item5_#SV = Try to learn how new words are typically formed in Swedish.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Reading_#A1_#Item6_#FI = Use whatever opportunities you can to read or listen to Finnish or use Finnish: at this level, any exposure to Finnish whether reading, writing, listening or speaking is likely to help you improve your reading ability.

ExpMedium_Head = Medium of test delivery
ExpSituation_Bullet1 = You use the language only for specific purposes or in specific contexts - for instance in relation to your work, your social life, your study interest or a personal interest. You therefore know the content area well and may be able to guess unfamiliar words and expressions within that context. DIALANG, however, covers a wide range of contexts and content areas and your language may therefore be 'stretched'.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#C1_#Item4 = Actively attempt to notice and question particular meanings of known words in context and other variants of the root word.

ExpAnxiety_Par1 = Certain tests can be so important for your later life (work, studies) that you feel very nervous when taking them. Although DIALANG is not such a high-stakes test, you may still feel nervous when doing the tasks.

Disclaimer_UseMisuse = DIALANG is a diagnostic test.  Its main purpose is to inform language learners about their level and about language learning.  DIALANG should NOT be used for certification purposes.<br /><br />Scroll down for more information ...<br /><br />DIALANG is a diagnostic test which gives you information about the strengths and weaknesses in your proficiency.  DIALANG does not give you a certificate which you could use, for example, to apply for a job or entry to an educational institution.  If you need such a certificate, you should take a language test offered by an officially recognized testing board either in your own country or abroad.<br /><br />DIALANG may help you decide which examination you would be able to pass, or whether you need to study a language further before taking such a test.<br /><br />DIALANG reports your level on a scale which divides language into 6 levels of proficiency, covering the full range of proficiency from beginner to very advanced.  This makes DIALANG more suited to measuring long-term rather than short-term improvement (or decline).  Note also that it is generally easier and quicker to progress from a lower level (e.g. A1 to A2) than from a higher level (e.g. B2 to C1).<br /><br />A note to course administrators:<br /><br />DIALANG tests which are fully calibrated could be used for placing students informally into different types and levels of instruction.  Check however that course content has sufficient similarity to the Common European Framework before using DIALANG for this purpose.  Make sure also that it is possible for the student to change course should the placement decision turn out to be wrong.<br /><br />For more information about the matters discussed above see also 'About Self-assessment' which you can find in the Feedback menu after taking a DIALANG test.

You are asked to respond to a number of statements about your ability to use or understand a language.  This task encourages you to reflect on your own language skills, which helps you to learn more effectively.  It may be that you under- or over-estimate your abilities, and if you appear to do so, DIALANG will tell you.

For example, learners who concentrate on studying grammar and vocabulary and on avoiding errors when they use language may think that their speaking and writing are poor because of the errors they feel they are making. Sometimes this feeling is reinforced by feedback from a teacher who may emphasise learners' problems and fail to acknowledge what learners can do with the language, despite all the errors. As a result, such learners may be surprised to get a higher grade on a language test than they expected because they had been paying attention to only one or a few aspects of proficiency (e.g. accuracy), whereas the test covers language proficiency in a more comprehensive way.

As with some school-based or national tests, some of these international tests can give you a fairly good idea where you stand against an international yardstick such as the Council of Europe six-point scale. However, you need to study what the test producers say about the meaning of their grades: some may report their results by using descriptions which are different from those used in the Council of Europe scale. To what extent do the two descriptions match or differ?

Caption_Available = available
ExpTimeAllowed_Par1 = In most tests you have only a limited amount of time at your disposal to complete the tasks whereas in real life, you may have more time available, like, for example, when you read a text. But the opposite can also be true: you may find some real-life situations more difficult than the test because you need to comprehend and react more quickly than in the test situation.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#B2_#Item1_#NO = Listen to radio programmes, watch TV and films in Norwegian as often as you can.
Title_ChooseTest = Choose a test
ExpOverestimate_Par2 = In the same way, you may have found speaking quite easy and consider that you can make yourself understood in most contexts, especially in those that you are familiar with. However, you may find writing (especially more formal writing) problematic because many writing contexts may require a higher level of accuracy than comparable speaking contexts. And you may find that texts and speech which contain a lot of densely packed, abstract information and ideas may be hard to understand because in your speaking you might have been in a position to choose when, what and how to speak and thus avoid using those expressions that you are not familiar with.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A2_#Item5_#PT = Try to write something every day in Portuguese; keep a diary, for example.

ExpSchoolTests_Par1 = Language tests at schools and other educational institutions often aim at ranking students in order to give them grades on the basis of mastery of the course or curriculum content. These tests may be valid for the purpose for which they are used but it is difficult for learners to draw conclusions about their absolute level of proficiency or about the meaning of the test results in terms of their ability to do things with the language. If your view of your language skills is mainly based on your school grades and tests at school, you may find it difficult to compare that against an international scale of proficiency such as the Council of Europe scale used in DIALANG. The content and standards (level of proficiency) required in school examinations vary from country to country, and even within one country, and it is thus difficult to relate these local standards to a wider, international standard.

TestResults_Text#Listening#B1 = Your test result suggests that you are at level B1 in listening on the Council of Europe scale. At this level, people can understand the main points of clear "standard" speech on familiar matters connected with work, school, leisure etc. In TV and radio current-affair programmes or programmes of personal or professional interest, they can understand the main points provided the speech is relatively slow and clear.
Welcome_Procedure_Text = The DIALANG system consists of several stages.  Click on the image below to find out what each stage is about.  Press the Forward button to go to the first stage.
TestResults_Text#Structures#C1 = Your test result suggests that you are at level C1 in structures on the Council of Europe scale.
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Writing_#A1_#Item5_#FR = Try to learn how new words are typically formed in French.

Questionnaire_Accuracy_Excellent = Very accurate
SelfAssessFeedback_NoTest_Par2 = Having a good sense of your own proficiency would enable you to set meaningful and realistic goals for your language learning.  However, we cannot tell whether you have a good sense of your own proficiency, so why not take the test?
ExpNumber_Par1 = Even a long and comprehensive language test can only contain a fairly limited number of tasks, simply for practical reasons. Your real-life experience (and therefore your self-assessment) may be based on many, many instances of language use. It may be that DIALANG or any other test you are evaluating does not contain enough of the language tasks that you have encountered (or they are different kinds of tasks compared with the way you use language, or they don't cover the same skills).
ExpOtherTests_Par2 = DIALANG encourages you as a language learner to critically evaluate what kind of information is useful for your learning. It may be that language test scores and other feedback that you get from tests are useful for you to plan and monitor your own learning, but it may also be that they are not. You need to evaluate the plausibility and usefulness of any test result or other information that you get from tests you have taken or will take in the future.
Caption_SubmitQuestionnaire = Submit the questionnaire
AdvisoryTips_Bullet_#Listening_#B1_#Item2_#PT = If you can see films with the original soundtrack in Portuguese, make a point of watching them. Subtitles, either in your own language or in the target language are useful; remember to listen too, however.
